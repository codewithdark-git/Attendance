# Attendance
 The Python script leverages the `face_recognition` library and OpenCV to create a real-time attendance tracking system. It loads known student faces and their information, recognizing faces through a webcam feed. Identified students are recorded in a CSV file with their ID, name, subject, and timestamp. The script presents a live display of recognized individuals and exits upon user input. Its efficient integration of facial recognition and data handling makes it a streamlined solution for automating attendance tracking in educational or organizational settings, offering a user-friendly interface and generating a comprehensive attendance log for future reference.
